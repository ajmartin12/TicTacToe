## Solving the problem
* Looked at other examples online, used a base set of code to understand how the logic works in figuring out the winner
* From there changed the code to make it mine, 
* Included loops to minimize the code. 
* Used a lot of DOM elements in the Javascript to make the game interactive.

## Unsolved Problems
* Trying to highlight the boxes of the winning line. 
* Finding a better way to have the inputs and information shown. Perhaps the use of modals will solve this issue.
